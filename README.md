## WIP

This project is a WIP. You can see an example in the URL for the project on Github. For now, I am prototyping out some UX ideas. Someday, it might grow into an engine capable of outputting embeddable static html based on configuration.

This also served as an exercise for me to learn gatsby. Should this project move forward, I don't think gatsby is the right choice. 

## Installation + Development

First install with `npm i`, then run:

`npm run develop`

## Deployment

Currently, this project is set to deploy to github pages. After running `npm i`, you can simply run:

`npm run deploy`
