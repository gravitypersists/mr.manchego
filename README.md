## WIP

This project is a WIP. You can see an example in the URL for the project on Github. For now, I am prototyping out some UX ideas. Someday, it might grow into an engine capable of outputting embeddable static html based on configuration.

## Installation

First install with `npm i`, then run:

`npm run develop`
